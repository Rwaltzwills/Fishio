# Fishio

A game about fishes, made in Godot 4.3

## Setting up the project locally

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)
- [Godot (obviously)](https://godotengine.org/)

### Cloning the project

In the terminal of your choice, go into the folder where you want the new project to be placed in, 
Then clone the project using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Rwaltzwills/Fishio.git
cd Fishio
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

These commands will clone the project into a folder called `Fishio` and download all the assets from 
Git LFS.
Then, you can launch Godot using `godot -e project.godot`, or just manually import the project in 
the Godot Project Manager. It'll work either way.
